FetchLinks for NewsGator Outlook Edition
========================================

Copyright © Graeme Foster 2003-4


3rd Party Bits
--------------

I have included the following libraries in binary form to ease building the FetchLinks source code:

1) Simon Mourier's HTML Agility Pack (HtmlAgilityPack.dll)
2) The required MbUnit assemblies (MbUnit.Core.dll and MbUnit.Framework.dll)
3) log4net (log4net.dll) - This product includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

I have included copies of the licences for the above in the /lib folder.

In addition to these, a reference to NGExtension.dll is required (supplied with NewsGator Outlook Edition). You might need to fix the reference to NGExtension if NewsGator is not installed to its default directory.
